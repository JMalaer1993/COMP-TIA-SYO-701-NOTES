OSI - Open Systems Interconnection: Describes the different activities that occur on a system.
  OSI Layers - Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away.
    Physical - Basic equipment such as copper wires or fiberoptic cables.
    Data Link - Switches operate here. Formats data into frames and delivers to systems within the local network using MAC address.
    Network - Sends information between systems outside the local network using IP addresses.
    Transport - Provides end-to-end communication services using TCP or UDP.
    Session - Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions.
    Presentation - Translates data into a standard format that can be understood by the application. Encryption and compression also occur at        this level.
  Application - Provides network services to applications.
Networking Protocols - Provide rules which allow computers to communicate with each other over the network.
  TCP - Transmission Control Protocol. Establishes session via three way handshake (SYN-SYN/ACK-ACK). Guarenteed delivery.
  IP - Internet Protocol. Identifies host in a TCP/IP network and delivers data to and from these addresses.
    IPv4 - 32 bit. Octets.
    IPv6 - Hexadecimal.
  UDP - User Datagram Protocol. No session. Send and hope for the best.
  HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Uses port 80.
  HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.
  SMTP - Simple Message Transfer Protocol.
  ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol. Tests basic connectivitiy. Commonly used for DoS attacks and therefore commonly blocked at the         firewall and router.
    PING - Checks for connectivity.
    Tracert - Trace network paths.
  ARP - Address Resolution Protocol.
